    It's been a couple months coming now, but I'm nearing version 1.0 of my
    power strip! You may be asking a few questions now, like "what power strip?"
    Well, after feeling frustrated about having to walk across the room to turn
    off a lamp with an awkward off-switch, I decided to over-engineer a
    solution.{" "}
  </p>
  <p>
    Starting with a power strip I found on Amazon, I began by taking it apart
    and looking at what I had to work with.{" "}
  </p>

  <p>
    Fortunately, this strip happened to leave a lot of space to work with. I
    began by disconnecting the physical relays. I had a series of 8
    electronically controlled relays, which I wired the outlets to after making
    sure I was properly handling mains-level current. With a few rudimentary
    python scripts in place, I had a working prototype! It looked like this:

  </BlogImage>
  <p>
    With that in place, I created a rudimentary Node server with a web view and
    used the strip that way for about a month. The server knew how to call ten
    python scripts, which would set the state of 5 GPIO pins to control the
    outlets. My webpage was incredibly minimalistic, and I only wrote buttons
    for the two outlets I was regularly using: a lamp and a space heater.{" "}
  </p>
  <p>
    It wasn't until June that I picked the project back up for some major
    revisions. Since I knew that needed to present a final project for
    Galvanize, I decided to take everything to the next level. I wanted a more
    intelligent server and view, and a much tidier and more compact piece of
    hardware. For the server, I decided to continue using Node.js with Express,
    and I decided that React.js had a philosophy of state that would suit this
    project particularly well.{" "}
  </p>

  <p>
    Using a switch animation I found on codePen (credited on the site and on
    github), I rebuilt the code in React and made it modular, creating one of
    the chief pieces of my view. Simple is better for an interface like this,
    and I wanted a UI that I would enjoy using from this point on. The next step
    was to take the power strip apart and do it better.
  </p>
  <BlogImage src="/static/gutted-strip.jpg">A new hope</BlogImage>
  <p>
    This time, I removed all of the physical switches, and carved out the
    support structures that surrounded them. I would need all the space I could
    get inside the strip for my next step.
  </p>

  <p>
    With these relays off ebay, I was effectively able to split the larger block
    I had used the first time, and now the relays could control their respective
    outlets from inside the power strip. Space was tight, but I was committed to
    fitting everything within the original housing.{" "}

  <p>
    The next steps required a live wire that would connect to each of the
    relays, and for each relay to have another wire completing the circuit with
    the socket. These relays require a 5v vcc input, and default to being closed
    unless they also receive a signal on their input pins. So, by default, the
    relays break the circuit for each outlet unless they are told to connect it
    again.

  <p>
    While I had originally been using a Raspberry Pi 1B, I got a notification
    that there were a few Raspberry Pi Zeroes in stock on Adafruit. I picked one
    up for $5 and was thrilled to downsize my controller for the project. In the
    picture above, you'll see that I manually soldered the GPIO pins on
    backwards for this device. It forced me to do some mental gymnastics for
    identifying pins, but it was necessary for how the pi would fit on the
    completed product.

    After creating an opening here on the side of the case, I had a space for
    the GPIO pins to point directly inside of the casing. Here, the Pi's ports
    would be available and on display in case I ever needed to further
    configuration. This way, I wouldn't need to open up the device constantly if
    something went wrong.{" "}

    After selecting and wiring up the pins, I faced a problem. The relays
    weren't switching on. With dozens of potential points of failure, I was
    overwhelmed and gave up for the rest of the day. I'm sure all you hackers
    out there know the feeling.
  </p>
  <p>
    The next day, after doing some research, I took a voltmeter to the pi and
    identified two points where I could directly have access to the full current
    of the usb input. It turned out that the pi was limiting the current as it
    passed through the circuit board, and not enough current was making it to
    the relays.

  <p>
    At long last, I was able to close the back of the strip, only to realize
    that I had wanted a couple cables to be directed inside the pi. The power
    cable was supposed to run through the inside, and the wifi dongle was meant
    to be housed inside the case. After cramming the cables through and
    re-soldering a couple broken connections, the cables all fit inside. With
    some minimal configuration to the server to update the GPIO pins, everything
    was working.{" "}
  </p>
  <p>
    Since then, I've been working to improve the interface. I've added
    functionality for scheduling events, and I'm working on scheduling repeating
    events currently. My next steps will be to create a view to view, modify, or
    cancel events, and to host an external website so that the strip will not
    require special router configuration to be controlled from a different
    network connection
