Let's get some things out of the way. I know that large swaths of cryptocurrencies and NFT's are scams and ponzi schemes. Deregulation of speculative markets hurts consumers, leading to fiascos like the FTX collapse. I've watched [Line Goes Up](https://youtu.be/YQ_xWvX1n9g).

In this article, I will not:

- Encourage you to buy anything
- Defend any particular coin or project
- Promise you liberation or financial freedom

Nevertheless, I have been a crypto worker for the last 3 years, and I have some unfashionable thoughts on the subject. I'm tired of hearing leftists gleefully write off decentralized technology, ceding ground to capitalists and the right. This is a realist's take on the potential of Web3, its limitations, and how it can be used to support collective ownership.

## What is Web3?

Web3, or Web 3.0 is a loosely-defined collection of technologies that use cryptographic signatures and proofs to run "trustless" software. It is more of a brand than a concrete set of specific technologies, but its general logic goes as follows:

### Where we were

In Web 1.0, we had peer-to-peer communications. The Internet, or the World Wide Web, was designed to enable individual researchers and students to share research, articles, and so on, from one machine directly to another. In the early days, you could visit an IP address directly, and a URL typically would point to a single machine, running in your garage or hosted by a single system administrator that you'd pay to keep your server alive. Websites were often updated directly using FTP, and that single machine would need to serve your entire website to any interested person in the world.

### Where we are

Web 2.0 reflects the post-dotcom rise of social media giants. Network effects drove centralization into titans like Facebook, YouTube, Netflix, and Google. For a number of reasons, these trends drove the creation of "the cloud", where first Amazon, then Microsoft and Google came to dominate hosting all the web experiences we consume. As consumers demanded more sleek, personalized, and fast services, it pushed the development of what's called "[edge computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_computing)", so that everyone is talking to servers that are physically close to them, with complex redundancies that have launched whole industries into optimizing.

In the broader US and global economy, we are seeing massive consolidation in nearly every aspect of life. Most food is produced by 10 companies. Disney continually absorbs more of the media landscape. Video game studios are converging into Sony and Microsoft, and so on. As far as the web is concerned, there are three areas of particular consolidation, with their own respective titans.

#### 1. Advertising

Google and Facebook dominate the world of advertising, bringing in [$224](https://www.statista.com/statistics/266249/advertising-revenue-of-google) and [$113](https://www.statista.com/statistics/271258/facebooks-advertising-revenue-worldwide/) billion respectively in 2022. Advertising is so pervasive on the modern web, that it barely registers to us, and the few frequently used websites without any like Wikipedia stand out as radical exceptions.

Advertising is the primary source of revenue for many forms of music and art, flattening those forms of expression into "content" which can deliver ads to consumers. Small businesses can occasionally see organic growth through social sharing or word of mouth, but most are beholden to pay to get placed on Facebook feeds or the top of Google's first page search results. Amazon has similar power when it comes to placement within the Amazon.com search rankings, although they haven't monetized it to the same extent yet.

This entire field is predicated on a specific value proposition. These companies say, "We have the most users. We know everything about our users. We can give you as many more customers as you can afford." They have the data to back it up! If you are keeping track, you can calculate out a level to spend, where you increase sales, balanced against the cost of the ad spend. As the internet is today, the optimal amount will almost never be zero.

#### 2. Hosting

Microsoft, Amazon, and Google earned $23.4, $18.4, and $5.8 billion from their web hosting services [in Q1 of 2022](https://www.silverliningsinfo.com/cloud/us-accounted-44-all-cloud-service-revenues-q1-2022-report). The migration to the cloud has been extremely profitable for hosting providers. It is difficult to compete with these big players, due to the challenges of coordinating a global system of servers that can scale up or down according to demand, have high levels of uptime, and so on.

What this means, though, is that for most people, everything online that is "yours" is functionally stored and facilitated by these three companies. Everything from your cloud photo storage, your government's email services, to your favorite Mastodon server are likely run on Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud.

This is the part where most crypto enthusiasts would start ranting about censorship. I personally don't see this as that significant of a problem, personally. These companies are mostly allowing whatever they can legally get away with in the municipalities in which they operate. Oppression of minority voices is far more complex than having a website taken off AWS, and it's reductive to pretend that guidelines around content moderation are a fully good or evil force. Websites that facilitate targeted violence and harassment are utterly toxic

#### 3. App stores

Apple and Google

### The overall goal

This isn't the most critical definition, but I've always appreciated the following definition of web3

## Coops and DAOs

In the crypto space, there is a type of organization that has many passionate members. A DAO, or "Decentralized Autonomous Organization" is an evolving type of corporate structure that has arisen to support the unique financial and organizational structures that come from running a blockchain-based business.

The specific problem that leads a group to form a DAO, generally speaking, is something like the following:

- Either through launching a token or by colecting tokens in the course of doing business, an organization has a significant collection of tokens relative to cash
- An organization wants to do business with a global audience, and to pay a global workforce
  - It is complicated enough to simply form a company in multiple countries, but between selling tokens for market vaue, making payments across borders, and so on, the financial system makes it remarkably difficult to compensate workers around the world. Larger companies can do it, but it is complicated
- It is risky to give any one person the authority to send tokens

Together, this has led to a nascent set of tools that use democratic procedures to coordinate collective action. DAOs take votes when they are making decisions about what should be done, how to spend money, and so on. Depending on the sophistication of the organization, they may even use cryptographic signatures to enforce the democratic nature of the organization. It is possible to require a quorum in order to upgrade code, make a transfer, and so on.
