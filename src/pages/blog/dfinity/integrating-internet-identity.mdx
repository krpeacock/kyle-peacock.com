Hi again! It's been an exciting couple of weeks. In case you missed it, I was a part of the Internet Computer Genesis event, and gave a talk on static site generators based on my blog post from a few weeks back. I've go ahead and added the video to [the original page](/blog/dfinity/static-site-generators-ic) if you want to check that out.

Another topic with a lot of emphasis during the event was the new Internet Identity application. I ended up joining that team, and was heavily involved in getting the first prototype running, as well as managing the JavaScript packages that support the app, and a new package dedicated to integrating with it.

## Back up, what's an Internet Identity?

To start, check out Dom's intro, and my colleague Joachim's presentation from the Genesis event.

The Internet Identity is a new authentication provider, filling a similar niche to the ubiquitous Login with Google or Facebook buttons you will see around the web.

From a user perspective, it is a way to bypass having to plug you information into every new site, so that you can just click a couple buttons and get on with whatever you wanted to do. From a developer perspective, this is another way that you can reduce friction for users on your app, so that you don't have to implement your own authentication strategy. It's a win-win, and that's why these tools are popular!

The Internet Identity at this stage knows almost nothing about you. There is no username or password. You don't provide an email to sign up. There are no seed phrases, One-time-passwords, authenticator apps, or email confirmations. It is built on the browser standard of Web Authentication, which has a significant level of support now and is getting better every year.

The Internet Identity app associates your various devices and gives you an identity that you can use seamlessly across applications once you've set them up.

## I'm easily sold on things. How do I get started?

I'm glad to hear it! Getting started is fairly simple, thanks to our npm package, [@dfinity/auth-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dfinity/auth-client).
