  Before I get started, I'm writing this between January 6, when Trump supporters
  stormed the US Capitol, and January 20th, when Joe Biden is set to be inaugurated
  as president. As unsettling as it is to see unfold, it is a reminder that the United
  States is still suffering under institutions that coddle white supremacy and racial
  resentment, stoked by income inequality and unscrupulous politicians. I'd like
  to simply state that Black and Indigenous lives matter, LGBTQIA+ lives matter,
  and that systems of power that benefit some over the good of the many are wrong,
  even when I am part of the group benefiting.

Curious about how frontend code works on the Internet Computer? Here's what I've learned after two weeks on the job.

## What you get in the starter

If you're following the [Quick Start guide](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/quickstart/quickstart-intro.html), you'll get some useful instructions on how to install the `dfx` sdk, leading you to create a templated project using `dfx new hello`.

Things will largely look familiar to you if you've been working with frontend code for a while. You've got `src` and `node_modules` folders, as well as `package.json` and `webpack.config.js` config files.

There is also a `dfx.json` config file, which is worth opening up and inspecting.

```json
// dfx.json
{
  "canisters": {
    "hello": {
      "main": "src/hello/main.mo",
      "type": "motoko"
    },
    "hello_assets": {
      "dependencies": ["hello"],
      "frontend": {
        "entrypoint": "src/hello_assets/public/index.js"
      },
      "source": ["src/hello_assets/assets", "dist/hello_assets/"],
      "type": "assets"
    }
  },
  "defaults": {
    "build": {
      "packtool": ""
    }
  },
  "dfx": "0.6.17",
  "networks": {
    "ic": {
      "providers": ["https://gw.dfinity.network"],
      "type": "persistent"
    },
    "local": {
      "bind": "127.0.0.1:8000",
      "type": "ephemeral"
    }
  },
  "version": 1
}
```

Inside, you'll see that the template has provided you with two "canisters": `hello` and `hello_assets`. Their names are generated to match the name of your new project you provided during `dfx new`.

Those canisters point to two directories under your `src` folder. One has some motoko code, and the other is JavaScript. If you're a person, the motoko code is probably new to you, but even the JavaScript has something that looks a little odd to you.

```js
// src/hello_assets/public/index.js
import hello from "ic:canisters/hello";

hello.greet(window.prompt("Enter your name:")).then(greeting => {
  window.alert(greeting);
});
```

The `hello` object imported from `ic:canisters/hello` is clearly nonstandard, but we'll get to what it's doing in a second.

## Build your starter

To get your starter running, you'll need to run a few commands. First, run `dfx start` and then open a new terminal tab or window.

In the new window, you need to create your on a local version of the internet computer, then compile your code.

```shell
dfx canister create hello
dfx canister create hello_assets
dfx build
```

Now, you should see that you have a `.dfx` directory, with a bunch of new content inside. The interesting bits will be the files inside of `.dfx/local/canisters`, inside the `hello` and `hello_assets` directories.

  <br />
  new dfx folder
</BlogImage>

You'll see that the canisters compile into `wasm` code, which is what runs on the canisters, as well as a candid type delcaration file `hello.did`, and JavaScript files that set up an interface for your API.

This code is what enables the `ic:canisters/hello` import that we saw earlier in our source code.

If you look into the `webpack.config.js`, you'll see that there is a pre-filled configuration that uses Webpack's alias feature to link your `ic:canisters/hello` to `.dfx/local/canisters/hello/hello.js`, along with its type declaration file `hello.did.js`.

If you're looking closely at `hello.js`, however, you'll notice something that's not immediately clear. It attaches its interface to a global object, `ic.agent`. You can run a search on your codebase, but you'll see that there's nowhere that sets up this global `ic` object that you can access.

Still, you can navigate to your browser, pull up `localhost:8000` and pass your canister id as a query parameter, and you'll get an html payload that loads and executes your code. The reason that the code works is that the asset canister has a few assumptions and some magic it's doing for you.

- An asset canister bootstraps your identity with html that initializes a global `ic` object and an anonymous identity.
- That anonymous identity allows you to request static assets, including your JS bundle.

From there, you have a workflow that will allow you to run a compile job and deploy a JavaScript application to the Internet Computer. You can work with any JavaScript technology that compiles with WebPack, and build your application.

## Wait, I have to manually build and deploy every time? That sounds slow and bad.

Yeah, I agree with you on that one, and I think we can make some big improvements. In my next post, I'll get into how you can use the `@dfinity/agent` package and a polyfill to create your own global `ic` object to start working with `webpack-dev-server` and enable a more modern workflow. We're actively working on making this process friendlier internally, but if you're eager to get started, you can check out our unofficial Create React App [DFX Template](https://github.com/taylorham/cra-template-dfx) work in progress.
