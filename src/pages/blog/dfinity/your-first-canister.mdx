So, you have some ICP utility tokens and you're interested in spinning up your first Canister on the Internet Computer. This guide will get you started with everything you need, and walk you step-by-step through everything you need to do, using the NNS dapp.

## Prerequesites

* A [https://nns.ic0.app](https://nns.ic0.app) wallet, logged in
* ~5 US dollars worth of ICP transfered to your wallet address
* Computer with `dfx` sdk installed from [https://sdk.dfinity.org](https://sdk.dfinity.org)

## Create your Canister

To begin, log in to your [https://nns.ic0.app](https://nns.ic0.app) account and verify your balance.

Next, navigate to the CANISTERS tab in the top right. You should see the screen below:

Click the blue Create or Link Canister button at the bottom of your page to open up the dialog.

Click the Create New Canister button. Then, select the ICP account that you want to use to fund your new canister.

You'll then be prompted to enter an amount. For now, we will enter 5 into the T Cycles (trillion cycles) input. 5 trillion cycles calculates to ~65Â¢ per 1T, so around $3.25 USD.

Creating a Canister comes with a 1T fee, so that will leave you with 4T cycles left to run your Canister.

Click Review Cycles Purchase, and then review on the following screen

Click confirm again, and then you should be good to go!

## Connecting your computer

For this example, I'll be using a [super minimal website](https://px4js-kiaaa-aaaah-aacqq-cai.ic0.app) as the app we are deploying. 

The app isn't important, but you should be in a directory with a valid dfx project for the next instructions. You can follow along directly by cloning this [example project](https://github.com/krpeacock/ic-static-minimal):

```shell-session
git clone https://github.com/krpeacock/ic-static-minimal.git
cd ic-static-minimal
```

Next, you'll need to get the principal from your computer by running

```shell-session
dfx identity get-principal
```

<BlogImage src={getPrincipal}>

</BlogImage>

Copy that principal id and head back to your tab with your newly created Canister. Click the blue Change Controllers button to open up the controller management UI.

<BlogImage src={addController}>
    Entering principal id as a controller
</BlogImage>

Enter your principal in the empty second input, and then click Perform Controller Change. This step authorizes your `dfx` on your computer to deploy to your newly created Canister.

<BlogImage src={confirmController}>

After you accept the confirmation, copy your Canister ID. We're going to use it now to deploy your first Canister.

## Deploy your Canister

Open up the example project, and open the file `canister_ids.json`. Replace `<canister-id>` with your Canister ID inside the quotes, and save the file.

<BlogImage src={customizeExampleSite}>
    Replace <code>{`<canister-id>`}</code> in <code>{`canister_ids.json`}</code>
</BlogImage>


Then, you'll need to run 

```shell-session
dfx deploy --network ic --no-wallet
```

to deploy an asset Canister, hosting the `index.html` file under `/assets`. This will deploy an incredibly simple static website to the Internet Computer. 

Breaking down the command, dfx is deploying the project using the config from `dfx.json`. We flag that the network should be IC, which is the production replica where you just created your Canister. Then, we say `--no-wallet`, indicating to DFX that you are deploying your Canister directly to an existing Canister using your principal.

Finally, once the deployment is successful, open up a tab in your browser to `<canister-id>.ic0.app`, once agein replacing `<canister-id>` with your Canister ID.

If all goes well, congrats! You should have your new site live on the Internet Computer.

Try making changes to `index.html` and re-deploying with `dfx deploy --network ic --no-wallet` to see your updates go out, running directly on the IC's distributed network!
