As of July 2022, I am in the process of getting my family documentation together to pursue German citizenship. It's an interesting journey, and I thought I would document some of my experiences here both to tell an interesting story and to hopefully help other people walk through the process themselves.

## The Law in Question

According to [german.info](https://www.germany.info/us-en/service/03-Citizenship/-/2479490):

> Under Section 15 of the Nationality Act, individuals who surrendered, lost or were denied German citizenship between January 30th 1933 and May 8th 1945 due to persecution on political, racial or religious grounds are entitled to naturalization.
>
> This ruling applies to:
>
> * Individuals who surrendered or lost their German citizenship prior to February 26th 1955, for example through acquisition of foreign citizenship on application, release on application or marriage with a foreigner, or
> * Individuals who were excluded from the legal acquisition of German citizenship through marriage, legitimization or collective naturalization of Germans due to their ethnic origin, or
> * Persons who were not naturalized following application or who were generally excluded from naturalization that would otherwise have been possible upon application, or
> * Persons who surrendered or lost their habitual abode in Germany if this was established prior to January 30th 1933 (in the case of children, also after this date).
> * Descendants of the above-mentioned individuals

This law initially covered people directly affected, but in the last couple of years, the interpretation of the law has now extended to descendants like me. 

## My Family's Story

My great grandparents were German Jews who fled to the US during the Holocaust. Walter Lowe and Henny Mann fled independently to Chicago in 1937 and 1938 respectively, where they met.
