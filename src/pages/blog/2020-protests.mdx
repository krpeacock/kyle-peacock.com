Y'all, it's been a minute.

On March 13, police officers broke into Breonna Taylor, a 26 year old woman's apartment, in a no-knock raid after midnight. Her boyfriend, a licensed gun-owner, fired at the unknown intruders, and the police shot Breonna 5 times in bed, killing her. She was an emergency room technician, a black woman, who had recently been telling her friends and family of her plans to start a family. Yesterday would have been her 27th birthday.

On Memorial Day, May 25th, we lost a man named George Floyd. George was known as a community leader and mentor to young men, played club basketball, and was an early performer in Houston's hip-hop scene. He had five children. In 2007, George took a plea deal for 5 years for taking part in an armed robbery. He was released after 4 years, getting involved with Resurrection Houston, a local church group. He moved to Minneapolis in 2014, and worked as a truck driver and most recently as a security guard, until he a was laid off due to covid-19. Police arrested George for allegedly passing a counterfeit \$20 bill. George was never tried for that charge, because the arresting officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeled on George's neck for 8 minutes and 43 seconds. George died 5 minutes into the hold, after crying out "I can't breathe", "Mama", and "please" repeatedly, but Chauvin continued kneeling on George's neck for an additional three minutes after George had no pulse.
